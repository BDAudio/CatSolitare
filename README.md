Hi everyone! I'm excited to share my project for the #AmazonQCLI challenge - a Cat Solitaire game. I decided to create this because when I was starting out (when Gateway still had commercials on cable) solitaire was always a coding exercise. Plus, I thought that if cats played 
card games, solitaire would definitely be one of them.
## The Challenge
"My challenge was twofold: First, complete the entire game during a single lunch break. Second, build it using only the command prompt without any manual editing. I started by creating a command-line version of the game in Python

The game features four cat types - Tabby, Black, Orange, and Calico - instead of the traditional card suits."
## The Conversion Process
After getting the command-line version working, I asked Amazon Q CLI to port it over to HTML and JavaScript. This is where things got interesting. The conversion process was remarkably smooth. Instead of writing sections of code manually, I could simply describe what I wanted and move on while Amazon Q handled the implementation. This gave me back significant time that would have been spent on 
boilerplate code.
## Challenges Overcome "The trickiest part was handling mouse movements for the card dragging functionality. In solitaire, you need to be able to grab cards,drag them around, and drop them in valid locations. Amazon Q CLI handled these complex interactions with only a few revisions. We (odd to say “we”) had to adjust how cards were selected, dragged, and displayed on top of other elements, but the tool was able to implement these changes quickly."
## Final Result 
Here's the final result - a fully functional Cat Solitaire game with drag-and-drop functionality, complete with paw print card backs and cat emojis instead of traditional suits. The whole experience was fun and really showcased how AI tools like Amazon Q CLI can enhance the development process rather than replace it. It allowed me to focus on the game design while handling the implementation 
details efficiently.


## Conclusion "Thanks for watching! If you want to try building something with Amazon Q CLI, I highly recommend it - especially for projects like this where you can iterate quickly and focus on the creative aspects. Happy coding...
